# README

Very simple webpage that displays random numbers that appear with nice animations.

I used this when I taught ESL in elementary school. The timing of the animations, the graphics, and the colors were all chosen to make it easy to see from the back of the classroom.

## Instructions

You can adjust the range of numbers to practice in the code. The default code shows how you can do a set range, order individual numbers, and do random number ranges without repeats. Mix and match as desired.

Feel free to use this on any browser as I believe it worked on browser as old as IE6.
